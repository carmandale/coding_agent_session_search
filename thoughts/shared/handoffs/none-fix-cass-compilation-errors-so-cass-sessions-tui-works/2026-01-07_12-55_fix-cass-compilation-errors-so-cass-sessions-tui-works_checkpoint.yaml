goal: Fix cass compilation errors so `cass sessions` TUI works
now: "Diagnosed that `cass sessions` command exists but does nothing; Discovered installed binary is v0.1.35 but `sessions.rs` TUI was added AFTER that release; Found root cause: **Bad merge at `bc52629`** lost critical code including:; `pub mod sources;` declaration in `src/lib.rs`; `src/search/vector_index.rs` module reference (though file never existed); Multiple `--source` CLI arguments; `SourcesCommand` subcommand; Confirmed 624 sessions exist in DB for PfizerOutdoCancerV2 workspace"

next:
  - Fix the bad merge - restore lost code from parent commit `0766143`
  - Verify compilation passes with `cargo check`
  - Build and install with `cargo install --path .`
  - Test `cass sessions` TUI works
blockers:
  - Need to carefully restore `sources` module without losing new `sessions.rs` functionality
  - "`vector_index.rs` was never created - was this intentional WIP or should it be removed from mod.rs?"
decisions:
  Decision: Reasoning
  Restore from merge parent `0766143`: This commit has `pub mod sources;` and other code lost in the bad merge
  Need to carefully merge, not just reset: The merge also brought in `sessions.rs` which we need to keep
worked:
  - Merge commit `bc52629` ("Merge swarm/opencode-connector-bwx into main") caused significant code loss
  - The `sources` module provides provenance/filtering functionality used throughout codebase
  - "`vector_index.rs` is declared in `mod.rs` but file doesn't exist even in parent - may be WIP"

    Continue working on: Fix cass compilation errors so `cass sessions` TUI works

    Context:
    - Bad merge at `bc52629` lost the `sources` module declaration and other code
    - Parent commit `0766143` has the correct `src/lib.rs` with `pub mod sources;`
    - The `sources/` directory exists with files but isn't declared in lib.rs
    - `vector_index.rs` is declared but doesn't exist (even in parent)

    Current state:
    - `cargo check` fails with ~24 errors
    - Main issues: missing `sources` module, missing `vector_index` module
    - Need to restore code from `0766143` while keeping `sessions.rs` additions

    Next steps:
    1. Add `pub mod sources;` back to `src/lib.rs`
    2. Remove or comment out `pub mod vector_index;` from `src/search/mod.rs`
    3. Restore lost CLI args (`--source`, `--by-source`, `SourcesCommand`)
    4. Run `cargo check` to verify
    5. `cargo install --path .` to install fixed version

    Key decisions already made:
    - Will restore from merge parent, not reset (need to preserve sessions.rs)
    - The `sources` module is required - many files depend on it
